          Download the launcher from <a href="https://github.com/Brick-Force-Aurora/Launcher/releases"
            target="_blank">GitHub</a>, run and install the game. Add your name into the email field and using the F4
          host menu host or join a game.

          After installing the game via the launcher, download the current DLL from <a
            href="https://github.com/TieHaxJan/Brick-Force/releases" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Go to the folder where
          you installed the game/launcher, navigate to <code>BrickForce_Data/Managed</code>, and replace the DLL there.
          Ensure everyone is on the same version to play together. Start the game using <code>BrickForce.exe</code> and
          not the Launcher.

          Get into a network with other players (VPN or LAN). Recommended service: Radmin VPN (Hamachi could also work,
          not tested). Allow any firewall exceptions that may pop up. One player acts as host and inputs their network
          IP in the Host IP text field (default value can be set in Config). Use <code>127.0.0.1</code> for solo
          testing. Host clicks "Host Match," and others click "Join Match." After connecting, click Play, create a room,
          and ensure everyone has the files for the current map loaded. The room master starts the match once all
          players are ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/watch?v=OuJ-qxDsTrA" target="_blank">Tutorial (German, English

          Most likely, something is faulty in your config. To fix this issue, go to the Registry Editor and navigate to:
          <code>Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\EXE Games\BrickForce</code>, and delete the EXE Games folder.
          Restart the game, and it should work.

        <p>
          Install Visual Studio 2022 and .NET Desktop Development. Using "Install or Change Feature," install .NET
          Framework 3.5. Open the solution file <code>Brick-Force.sln</code>. Install the Launcher and the Game into the
          same folder where the Brick-Force Repository Folder is to resolve all dependencies (e.g.,
          <code>Folder/BfLauncher</code> and <code>Folder/Brick-Force</code>). Change the Build Output Path to
          <code>Brick-Force_Data/Managed</code> in project properties. If necessary, reimport
          <code>ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll</code> as a reference. To debug, select <code>Brick-Force.exe</code> as the
          external program.
