            <p>Greetings Community,</p>
            <p>
              We're excited to announce the next version of <strong>2.0.0.</strong> The update is available in the
              Launcher and adds the
              following features:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>üõí Fixes for Shop and Inventory</li>
              <li>Implemented Steam API for matchmaking, networking and friends (Spacewar)</li>
              <li>Added new, more advanced menu based on Dear ImGui (F6)</li>
              <li>Added new config options</li>

            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This marks a big change in how this mod works, as you can now play via Steam with all the features that
              come with it.</p>
            <P>Steam enables us to have a centralized lobby system where you can create and join lobbies with a lobby
              list.
              You can also invite Steam friends or join their lobby directly.</P>
            <p>The new networking also happens through Steam and you won't have to use the old method via raw IP anymore
              (it's still there if you need it).</p>
            <p>As always, you can grab the update from the launcher, but to enable Steam play, some additional steps are
              required:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Install and run Steam, create or login to your Steam account</li>
              <li>Install 'Spacewar' (Proxy for Steamworks API access) to your Steam Library by opening
                steam://install/480/ in your browser while Steam is running</li>
              <li>Run Brick-Force through BfLauncher.exe or BrickForce.exe while Steam is running</li>
              <li>Steam should show you as playing 'Spacewar'</li>

            </ul>
