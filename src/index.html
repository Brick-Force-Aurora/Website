            <p>Greetings Community,</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              As you might have noticed, no developer-diary has been published.
              Fact is, sadly: we had to stop the development of Brick-Force. The
              original developer left us the game in a state that makes it
              impossible for us to extend or update the game. That means we are
              not able to apply bugfixes or new content.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              At the same time, we must announce that our last active member,
              WashburneX, will leave the game. Support and sales will no longer
              happen. We hope we will find a solution for the sales, but for the
              time being, there won&rsquo;t be any new sales.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              If you have any support-requests, please ask the remaining
              community-moderators and your co-players.
              <strong>All request we receive that are not payment-related will not be
                handled.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Regarding the elephant in the room: No, we will not shut down the
              game yet. We will inform you when the time comes.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Thank you all for your loyalty and the fun we had. We hope we can
              continue to have more of it for a long time to come.
            </p>
            <p>Thanks for everything and till then!</p>
            <p>Cheers!</p>
            <p>WashburneX &amp; Your Brick-Force-Team</p>
