          There are no restrictions, everyone can play. All you have to do is
          register an account and either download the client or play in your
          internet browser.

          Yes, there will no longer be any point resets or inventory wipes.
          Everything you do in Brick-Force from now on will be saved – to
          infinity and beyond!

        <p>
          Enter the shop section “Upgrades” to buy a Gem. Select an item that
          you want to upgrade by clicking on it in your inventory and click the
          little blue “Item Upgrade” button on the bottom to enter the upgrade
          interface. Upgrading an item which has not yet been enhanced will
          never fail. However, if you upgrade an already enhanced item, there
          might be a chance of failure. Elite Gems give you the ultimate
          upgrade. They will never fail, aren’t bound to any rank and you can
          select yourself which property you want to upgrade.
